This repository demonstrates an uncommon Java bug related to the scope of variables within a try-catch-finally block. The code attempts to parse a string containing non-numeric characters, which leads to a NumberFormatException. The catch block handles the exception, however the finally block prints the value of x which is not updated.  The solution provides an improved approach to handle this scenario effectively.
